MLQ Scheduler

Developed a CPU scheduling simulator that implements the Multilevel Queue Scheduling algorithm in Operating Systems. The project categorizes processes into multiple queues based on priority and scheduling policy, enabling each queue to utilize different algorithms, such as FCFS and Round Robin. It calculates and displays key metrics, such as waiting time, turnaround time, and average performance, showcasing concepts of process management, queue handling, and CPU optimization.

This folder contains a React + TypeScript UI for a multi-level queue scheduler demo. It's scaffolded for Vite and Tailwind.
